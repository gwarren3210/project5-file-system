  “Academic honesty” means demonstrating and upholding the highest
  integrity and honesty in all the academic work that you do as an
  individual (not in a group assignment). In short, it means doing
  your own work and not cheating, and not presenting the work of
  others as your own. This includes cheating, deception, fabrication,
  and plagiarism. At this point in your academic career you should
  know what is right and what is not. If you are unclear about what
  constitutes academic honesty you must talk to the professor of this
  course.

  //   reading in the free block list. To do this:
  // Move the file pointer to the start of the disk file.

  //   allocate a new file of this size

  // If not, repeat the above two steps until you find a free inode
